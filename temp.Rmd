This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
file <- "activity.zip"
csv <- "activity.csv"

if (!file.exists(csv)) {
  download.file(url, file, method = "curl")
  unzip(file)
}

f <- read.csv(csv)
d <- f
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d$date <- as.character(d$date)
d$date <- as.Date(d$date, "%Y-%m-%d")

dailytotal <- aggregate(d$steps, by = d[c("date")], sum)
hist(dailytotal$x, breaks = 20, xlab="Steps", main="Total steps taken daily")
mean(dailytotal$x, na.rm = T)
median(dailytotal$x, na.rm = T)

dailymean <- aggregate(d$steps, by = d[c("interval")], mean, na.rm=T)
names(dailymean) <- c("interval", "steps")
plot(dailymean, type="l")
dailymean[dailymean$steps == max(dailymean$steps),]
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
